## 👋 Hello, I'm Jijith MS

I’m a full-stack **.NET Developer** with a passion for crafting scalable, high-performance applications. With hands-on expertise in **ASP.NET Core**, **Angular**, **Azure**, and **SQL Server**, I bring both backend robustness and frontend finesse to the table.

I take **complete ownership** of everything I do — from understanding business goals to delivering production-ready solutions. Lately, I've been diving deep into the world of **Generative AI**, exploring how it can transform user experiences and development workflows.

## 💼 What I Bring to the Table

- 🔹 Strong backend development using **.NET Core & C#**
- 🔹 Frontend experience with **Angular** and responsive UI design
- 🔹 Cloud-native app development & deployments with **Microsoft Azure**
- 🔹 Efficient data management using **SQL Server**
- 🔹 Exploring and integrating **Generative AI** into real-world apps
- 🔹 A collaborative mindset with a get-it-done attitude

## 🎯 Beyond the Code

Outside of the IDE, I’m someone who finds joy in the little things that spark curiosity and adrenaline:

- 🚗 I love going for long drives — there's nothing like the calm of a late-night ride.
- 🏸 Badminton is my go-to sport — it keeps me sharp, focused, and moving.
- ❄️ A cold, misty climate? That’s my happy place.
- 🎬 And if there’s a gripping **investigative thriller** playing, I’m all in — decoding plots is almost as fun as debugging code!
